<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Hello!</h3>
<p>I'm Julian, a 4th year undergrad at Stanford University, where I study computer science. I'm broadly interested in how we might create systems that match both the efficiency and capabilities of the human brain:)</p>
<p>For the past couple of months I was working on interactive video generation at a chip startup called Etched, where I helped create <a href=https://oasis-model.github.io>Oasis</a>. Before that, I worked as a kernels engineer at <a href="https://cohere.com">Cohere</a> and <a href="https://mosaicml.com">MosaicML</a> to reduce the memory footprint of serving large GPT models. I was the first hire at <a href="https://chord.pub">Chord</a>, an internet research agent (acq. by Newsweek). And in a past life, I worked with the <a href="https://hoganlab.stanford.edu">Hogan Lab</a> on an atom interferometer for detecting gravitational waves.</p>
<p>These days, I'm most excited about the future of world modeling, the intersection of neuroscience and AI, end-to-end robotics models, and full-stack ML systems optimization. I'm also trying to learn more about the history of computing and research organizations. In my free time I love to go on walks, and sometimes I <a href="/sketches/">draw with code</a>. If you'd like to talk about any of these topics, or anything else at all, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
