<p>3-dimensional L-system with phototropism. I learned about this algorithm from <a href="https://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/#abop">The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants</a>, which is awesome and historical. L-systems, combined with the invention of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/325165.325250">particle systems</a> at Pixar, led to the creation of the forest scene from <i>The Adventures of Andr√© & Wally B</i> in 1984.</p>

<p>It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Andr%C3%A9_%26_Wally_B.">landmark</a> in computer graphics, I think, because it was the first 3D rendering which felt like a <i>world</i>. I still think it's very beautiful, even by today's standards, and it would be cool to recreate it one day.</p>
