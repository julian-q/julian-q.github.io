hi linda!

wow, we've been together for 3 years now. here are some things i love about being with you:

1. you love learning. i really like it when you send me little snippets of what you're reading and thinking about. i've always really loved this.

2. your values. i often find myself super stressed out about stupid things, for exampling when I'm trying to "optimize". talking to you during these times makes me feel a lot better because you help me focus on learning and curiosity.

3. your drive. i've loved this about you since i first met you. i think if your three-years-aago self could see you now, you would be really amazed. it's thanks to the fact that you never give up.

happy borthday!

you're a CS major, you run distributed training jobs, training language models on reasoning tasks! you've taken three AI classes, had your first internship as an ML engineer, and you got super good grades in 224R. you've grown so much in confidence, and you have a resume full of cool engineering stuff!
