        you've accepted your feelings, and you've even started to question them. but as soon as you share the same physical space, the questions don't matter anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
        you adore them: the way they think, the way they talk, the way they walk. you adore them so much you don't mind the massive bite mark on their neck.
    </p>
    <p>
        you've never quite adored someone like this before. you are just <a href="/moments/special/7087.html">happy they exist.</a>
