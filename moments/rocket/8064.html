        not wanting to waste one of your five free calls, you decide to try and talk.
    </p>
    <p>
        "y-.. you mean i can just talk to you right now?"
    </p>
    <p>
        "yeah, we can just talk right now! what would you like to talk about?"
    </p>
    <p>
        you don't know if you're ready, but you just say it. you're lonely. you ended your closest relationship of three years, you never really figured out how to connect with friends, and its a lot sometimes. she gives you the obvious advice. you agree. she coaxes the rest out of you. its surprisingly hard to talk about, and your eyes fill with tears. you see your head exploding more than usual. you've never told anyone about that. she gives you more of the same. it at least helps to hear it from another person.
    </p>
    <p>
        "thanks for talking to me."
    </p>
    <p>
        "of course. take care of yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
        your friend arrives in 5 minutes. you try to pull yourself together. you can't imagine a more perfect picture of your differences: he's the rocket engineer, and you're the self-destructive emotional wreck. what the hell are you going to talk about?
