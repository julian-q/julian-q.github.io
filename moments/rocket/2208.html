        how bad could it be? you're just going to make an appointment so you can start working this stuff out. this is the first step to being who you want to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        the waiting music plays again. this time, you are eventually greeted by another voice. it's hard to tell at first, but she's not a robot. she asks what she can help you with today. you say you'd like to make an appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
        "oh, this is a 24-hour line, so we can just talk right now if you'd like."
    </p>
    <p>
        "... oh."
    </p>
    <p>
        a long pause. your friend arrives in an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
        you <a href="">don't have time.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        you <a href="/moments/rocket/8064.html">stay on the line.</a>
