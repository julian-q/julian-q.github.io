        you try to make your room more presentable. as you put pick your dirty clothes off the floor and clean off your desk, you realize the recycling bin has become a precariously stacked mountain of cardboard twice as tall as the bin itself. you need to finally deal with that.
    </p>
    <p>
        carefully, you pick up the bin and try and try to make it down the stairs without dropping all of it. you still end up dropping everything, but at least you made it pretty close to the dumpster outside. you pick the last of it up from the ground and toss it.
