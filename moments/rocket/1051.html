        the water is warm. it feels good against the tight muscles of your back. it soothes the scalp beneath your matted hair.
    </p>
    <p>
        it feels so good that you start to feel kinda better, too. you think you might finally try to get some help. you turn off the water and dry your body.
    </p>
    <p>
        back in your room, you clean things up. you have to finally deal with the precarious mountain of cardboard that has become your recycling bin. carefully, you take the bin out to the dumpster.
