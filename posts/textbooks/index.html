    <h2>my fave textbooks</h2>
    <p></p><a href='http://www.algorithmsilluminated.org'>
        <strong><i>Algorithms Illuminated</i></strong>
    </a></p>
    <p>
        This is <a href='http://timroughgarden.org'>Tim Roughgarden's</a> amazing series on algorithm design. It covers all the essential skills a programmer must have, and is written in such a friendly, conversational way that it's a real page-turner. I wish more textbooks were written like Tim's!

        <strong><i>Math 51 Textbook</i></strong>
    </a></p>
    <p>
        Linear algebra has a tendency of being the most useful thing ever. This textbook is a great intro to the core math skills for science, and is <i>rich</i> with applications. I took this class in Fall 2020, but keep going back to it every month or so because it's got so much good stuff.

        <strong><i>Linear Algebra Done Right</i></strong>
    </a></p>
    <p>
        To be honest, Math 51 kinda went over my head when I took it (maybe <i>too</i> much good stuff). If you want to feel like you truly understand linear algebra, this is how you do it right. <a href='https://axler.net'>Sheldon Axler</a> starts from the very beginning, building everything up from the axioms. It's also a great intro to pure math, and the proofs are super clean!

        <strong><i>Groups and Symmetry</i></strong>
    </a></p>
    <p>
        If you liked <i>Linear Algebra Done Right</i>, you'll love this. Now that you've seen how vector spaces are constructed, you'll marvel at the parallels in the structure of groups. And, now that you know what the heck a matrix is, you'll feel right at home when Armstrong introduces group representations. It's so cool to see the similarities between group -morphisms and the linear transformations studied in Axler. I read these two simultaneously, which was really fun.
