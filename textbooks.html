            This is <a href='http://timroughgarden.org'>Tim Roughgarden's</a> amazing series on algorithm design. It covers all the essential skills a programmer must have, and is written in such a friendly, conversational way that it's a real page-turner. I wish more textbooks were written like Tim's!

            <strong><i>Math 51 Textbook</i></strong>
        </a></p>
        <p>
            Linear algebra has a tendency of being the most useful thing ever. This textbook is a great intro to the core math skills for science, and is <i>rich</i> with applications. I took this class in Fall 2020, but keep going back to it every month or so because it's got so much good stuff.

            Linear algebra is super useful. But to be honest, Math 51 kinda went over my head when I took it (maybe <i>too</i> much good stuff). If you want to feel like you truly understand linear algebra, this is how you do it right. <a href='https://axler.net'>Sheldon Axler</a> starts from the very beginning, building everything up from the axioms. It's also a great intro to pure math, and the proofs are super clean!

            If you liked <i>Linear Algebra Done Right</i>, you'll love this. Now that you've seen how vector spaces are constructed, you'll marvel at the parallels in the structure of groups. And, now that you know what the heck a matrix is, you'll feel right at home when Armstrong introduces group representations. It's so cool to see the similarities between group -morphisms and the linear transformations studied in Axler. I read these two simultaneously, which was really fun.

            Behold, the combination of ML and beautiful abstract math. Having studied both linear algebra and group theory, you'll now be ready for a super cutting-edge application at the forefront of machine learning.
