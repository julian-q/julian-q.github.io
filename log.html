            so, what even is this page? well, it's a log. of basically everything that happens on any given day of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            there are people that i look up to, i care about, or i am just curious about. i wish i knew more about them. i wish i knew what they actually <i>did</i> and <i>thought about</i> all day.
        </p>
        <p>
            i don't think the world's dying to know the details of my day-to-day. i don't know if anyone will read any of this at all. but maybe, if i start writing now, someone will find this page in the future and it will help them.
        </p>
        <p>
            for the past six years, i've thought pretty regularly about wanting to lead a more intentional life. ironically, i don't think i've been very intentional about wanting to be more intentional. at this point, i've accumulated a lot of ideas about what would make me happier, but never really committed to any of them. now, i think its a good time to try and do some of those things. like anyone else, i'm on a journey to better understand myself and to love life. i'm going to try and be as honest as possible in documenting that journey. maybe you'll find that our journeys are completely different. or, maybe you'll find that our journeys have some things in common.
